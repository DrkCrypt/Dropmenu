    <h1>Cmail Privacy and Data Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview of how Cmail works</strong></p>
    <p>
        Cmail works by transferring data to and from your Gmail account. Most of this data transfer occurs via numeric identifiers specific to Gmail and the Gmail API. In some cases, email addresses are transferred from the Cmail server back to the Gmail interface, but in a secure manner over SSL. Gmail does not allow a third-party integration like Cmail to connect to account data without the use of SSL.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>How are your email lists used?</strong></p>
    <p>
        In order to track opens, clicks, and provide unsubscribe functionality via the Cmail unsubscribe link, our database does store the email addresses to which you are sending email. This data is stored in a database, secured by two layers of firewalls, and is never shared with any third parties. Cmail is similar in this regard to well-known email marketing systems like MailChimp, where storage of email addresses is required to provide standard email marketing features.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Does Cmail store the content of your email message?</strong></p>
    <p>
        No. Unlike a traditional email marketing service like MailChimp, the Cmail database does not store the contents of your email marketing campaigns, except for the From Address used for each campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
        We store the From Address because in Gmail, multiple From Addresses can be authorized for use in a single Gmail account, and by storing the From Address, we are better able to support users by being able to look up their Cmail account when they tell us they sent a campaign “from” a certain address.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not store the content (Subject / Message) of email campaigns, but the content does pass through our server ephemerally. This is required in order to add the mechanisms to an email message that allows Cmail to track opens and clicks on individual email messages. This process happens in microseconds and the content of an email message does not live on our server beyond that.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Does Cmail share any of your email list information with third parties?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We may share your email list information with third-party service providers, including advertising platforms such as Google, to assist in delivering targeted advertising campaigns. These third parties are required to use the information only for these purposes and in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We do not sell or trade your email information for any other purposes.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Deletion Requests</strong></p>
    <p>
        In compliance with GDPR, any user may request that his/her data be deleted from our servers. To make such a request, send an email to <a href="mailto:datadeletion@wordzen.com">datadeletion@wordzen.com</a> from the Cmail account whose data you wish to be deleted.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Email Warmup</strong></p>
    <p>
        Cmail does not provide email warming services for Google accounts.
